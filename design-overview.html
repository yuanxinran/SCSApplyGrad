              Based on our research, we summarized the three main directions we wanted to explore to create a better

          <p>With the above 3 design directions we identified in our research, we defined the following three levels of

          <h5>Level 1: Designing for Efficiency</h5>
          <p>
            Throughout research, we discovered that to find evidence from different materials, reviewers usually perform
            what we called “swiveling”, i.e. switching back and forth between different materials to form a
            comprehensive view of an applicant’s experiences. Current ApplyGrad interface didn’t support this action,
            which constantly breaked reviewers’ thought flow and contributed to longer review times and lower
            efficiency.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>Also, since the only way to record ideas in ApplyGrad is using the review form, there’s no way to link
            reviewers’ evaluation to any rational or evidence found in materials. As a result, after a few weeks or
            months, during the committee meeting where reviewers discuss applicants together, some reviewers tend to
            forget details why they evaluated applications in a certain way.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>According to reviewers in our interviews, this happens frequently and reviewers take time to go back to the
            raw materials to look up for evidence, which leads to inefficient meeting discussions.
          </p>
          <br>
          <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-8 col-sm-8 row d-flex justify-content-end">

              <div class="callout-content">
                "You can see [during admission meetings] some reviewers forgot why they gave certain evaluations and
                started to do the review on the fly, which is not good."

          </div>
          <br>
          <p>
            Moreover, many reviewers are not even aware of functionalities existing in ApplyGrad such as choosing what
            columns to display in the data table. This is mostly a result of having too much information displayed on
            one interface in the old ApplyGrad, and reviewers naturally ignore many elements on the periphery of the
            pages. Not knowing and utilizing useful functionalities in ApplyGrad puts the efforts of developing the
            system in vain and add much extra work and friction for reviewers.
          </p>
          <br>
          <div class="tiny-title">Reduce Swiveling</div>
          <p>In order to reduce the need to swivel between materials and windows, instead of having the reviewer to open
            all application materials in different tabs, we merged all application materials into one PDF document and
            added a table of contents to support easier navigation. Also, we put the review form, usually alongside to
            keep all main user tasks within the system. This way, reviewers do not have to click deep into an applicant
            and back out to get to the next review.
          </p>
          <br>
          <div class="tiny-title">Record of Evaluation Evidence</div>
          <p>Reviewers hold a lot of information in their head when reviewing. It’s often hard to keep track of, so they
            use either external spreadsheets or physical notebooks to help them keep track. We wanted to optimize their
            time in the system by giving reviewers the functionality of highlighting, commenting, and annotating.

          <div class="tiny-title">Reduce Clutter in Display
          </div>
          <p>In our design, we focused on reducing unnecessary information and constructing progressive disclosure for
            elements displayed on different screens. Not only did this result in clear interfaces, it also reduced the
            possibility of reviewers being overwhelmed by the abundant of functionalities on one interface and not using
            many features we developed.
          </p>

          <br>
          <h5>Level 2: Designing for Effectiveness</h5>
          <p>
            There’s a significant difference between efficiency and effectiveness in the context of application review
            work. Efficiency emphasizes on the speed of doing review work, while effectiveness focuses on the fairness
            in review and how in-depth the review work is. It’s dangerous to singly pursue efficiency in review, as the
            work is inherently time-consuming and speeding through the materials will inevitably lead to a shallow, not
            comprehensive understanding of applicants’ backgrounds and experiences.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            In our project, we prioritize effectiveness over efficiency, which is inline with the insights we discovered
            from our research. Many reviewers expressed that they are willing to spend a good amount of time on an
            application if in-detail assessment requires it. With this in mind, we included the following features that
            helps to make the review process more effective:
          </p>
          <br>

          <div class="tiny-title">Reducing Cognitive Load</div>
          <p>
            Reviewers often hold a lot of information in their head when reviewing, which it’s often hard to keep track
            of. In our spring research, we found that many reviewers use either external spreadsheets or physical
            notebooks to help them keep track of their notes. We wanted to optimize their time in the system by giving
            reviewers the functionality of highlighting, commenting, and annotating.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>Reviewers said that they would be the most likely to use highlighting and annotation functions for reviews
            because it is similar to their actual workflow. People liked how how highlighting and annotating is optional
            and would not add any additional time to their review since it’s something that they already do.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>In addition, some reviewers also expressed interest in using different colors to distinguish highlights
            about different topics or added by different reviewers. </p>
          <br>
          <div class="tiny-title"> Visual Summaries
          </div>
          <p>Reviewers liked seeing notes compiled together. They often do it to recalibrate their reviews or for
            admission committee purposes, in which they can select different points to discuss about candidates. In the
            early version of our prototype, we tested how commenting and tagging would work, giving it search
            functionalities.
          </p>
          <br>
          <!-- TODO: Add an image of visual summaries we have -->

          <p>
            A repeating theme for review work is that people often want to have easy access to their notes and
            annotations while doing final evaluations. Reviewers tend to store their notes in external spreadsheets or
            physical notebooks, and refer to them while filling in the review forms. Since our design has reviewers put
            notes directly linked to application materials in ApplyGrad, we automatically populate the notes to the
            review form field that each note is associated with. This supports a better evidence-based review process as
            reviewers’ evaluation fields in the review forms are now accompanied by their own annotations in the
            materials.

          </p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h5>Level 3: Designing for Experience</h5>
          <p>The current experience of using ApplyGrad is far from fun and enjoyable. Using our research data, our team
            constructed the following reviewer journey map to represent their experience in the system.
          </p>

          <!-- TODO: Image of journey map (in figma) -->
          <p>
            While trying to improve the usefulness of ApplyGrad, we specifically put effort into improving the
            experience of reviewers in our system, to make the process less stressful and straining, and more rewarding.

          </p>
          <br>
          <div class="tiny-title">A New Look – Updating Aesthetics for Anti-stress</div>
          <p>One of the things we discovered from our research was that the interface of the original ApplyGrad is very
            cluttered and causes confusion for both new and old ApplyGrad users. We made improvements to the interface
            by reducing the clutter and introducing a cleaner design that makes it easier for reviewers to process
            information.
          </p>
          <br>
          <!-- TODO: Add image of interface change in report -->
          <br>
          <br>
          <div class="tiny-title">Anti-Stress – Adding Positive Feedback</div>
          <p>Reviewers spend multiple hours reviewing applications for their respective programs, but don’t get any
            positive feedback from the system. From our research, we found that reviewers want to feel a sense of
            accomplishment when they completed a review. Thus, we explored the integration of features in the system
            that celebrate reviewers’ progress in the review process with a thank you message/celebration in order to
            give them a sense of accomplishment and a confirmation of their completed review.</p>
