                In the first phase of our project, the team focused on
                understanding ApplyGrad and the admissions process by
                departments. We probed into the needs of administrators and
                reviewers to find efficiency and equity opportunities. We used a
                combination of primary and secondary research methods including
                contextual inquiries, surveys, pretotypes, semi-structured
                interviews, expert interviews as well as literature research in
                machine learning and competitive analysis. We synthesized the
                research findings using affinity diagraming, stakeholder &
                journey maps, and “How might we” questions.

            <p>
              To begin our research into ApplyGrad, we set up contextual
              inquiries with administrators across various departments in SCS.
              We chose to interview administrators first because they hold the
              most knowledge of the department’s visions and rules. Our focus
              was to
              <strong
                >understand the different procedures, values, and stakeholders’
                tasks in the admission process and the role that ApplyGrad plays
                in it.</strong
              >
              We obtained insights from eleven master’s programs representing
              six out of seven departments in SCS.

              We created journey maps and stakeholder map for each interview

              these stakeholders in the ApplyGrad ecosystem as well as find the
              commonalities amongst the various departments and programs. Based
              on the individual journey maps, we created a 'general' journal map
              to visualize the overall admission process in SCS across different
              departments.

              To understand reviewers' thought process when reviewing
              applications and how they use the ApplyGrad system, we conducted
              contextual inquiries with reviewers from four different programs.
              We developed fake application based on the middle applicants for
              each program. During the interview, we asked reviewer to review
              the fake application and think aloud in the process.

              opportunities across different stages of the admissions process.
              To gather feedback on what direction to prioritize, we decided to
              use storyboards as our pretotype and speed-dated them with

              One of our client's long-term project visions is to help reviewers
              make more effective and efficient admission decisions with
              automation support. With the rapid advancement in ML, there also
              comes

              into ApplyGrad, we interviewed experts in the following three
              areas: Technical details, Equity and fairness and ML as a design
              material. We also consulted experts in diversity, equity and
              inclusion (DEI) for recommendation on practices to ensure the
              fairness of the admission process.

            <p>
              To understand how other platforms are approaching in similar
              areas, we performed a competitive analysis on similar systems to
              ApplyGrad. These platforms include Interfolio and Slate, which
              some SCS departments use for their admissions process, as well as
              the recruiting platform Element451.
              <br />
              <br />
              One direction that we are exploring is an intervention to help
              reviewers keep track of their progress in committee meetings, or
              to remind them if there is an important component of an
              application that they have not yet addressed. Thus, we also looked
              at speech analysis platforms and speech-to-text AI systems such as
              Otter.ai, Primer.ai, Abridge, and MedRespond.

              For our pretotype, we wanted to explore boundaries for possible ML
              interventions, understand the similarities and differences across
              departments in evaluating applicants, and assess the impact of
              interventions at various stages of the admissions process. Our
              hypothesis was that interventions to help reviewers group,
              compare, and filter applicants quickly will help the efficiency
              and expedite the admissions process.
              <br /><br />
              We designed and presented five storyboards about problems in the
              admissions process and potential solutions around machine learning
              and automation. The participants, four reviewers representing 4
              different sized departments in the SCS, then co-designed and
              reflected on the solution’s implications.

              We conducted the <strong>Speed-Dating</strong> sessions with four
              masters program reviewers from four different departments: MHCI,
              MLT, MSAS, and MSPE. We intentionally recruited from these four
              departments to have a diversity in the size of applicants and
              students (the small departments are MSAS and MSPE with 0-199
              applicants, the medium department is MHCI with 200-499 applicants,
              and the large department is MLT with 500+ applicants).
              <br /><br />
              During the interview, we presented participants with several
              storyboards developed based on our previous research. A storyboard
              usually contains four frames: context, problem, solution, and
              resolution. For each storyboard, we pre-filled two frames for
              participants and asked them to fill the remaining two frames based
              on their admission experience. They could have multiple designs
              for each storyboard; for example, for storyboards with the empty
              ‘Problem’ frame, they could generate more than one problem for the
              context.
              <br /><br />
              After they filled in the corresponding frames, we prompted them to
              reflect on their experience as a reviewer and how their solution
              might impact the process. We asked them open-ended questions about
              any potential concerns they had, as well as asking them to use a
              Likert scale to rank how their solution would impact the
              effectiveness, efficiency, fairness of the admissions process.

              For the most part, reviewers reacted negatively to ML taking part
              in the decision-making process and prefer it as a tool to check
              after they have made their own judgement calls. Through our
              storyboards, the need to develop a better note-taking system has
              been validated the most with grouping and filtering coming in
              next. It seems like the most needed design is something that can
              help reviewers remember applicant data.

                We should aim to develop tools that can facilitate helping

              </li>
              <li>
                ApplyGrad could use some additional data and filter features
                that help people make decisions and calibrate reviews.
              </li>
              <li>
                We should not aim to use ML to make decisions for reviewers.
                Even when making recommendations, perhaps make it optional and
                keep in mind how it still may influence the order or way a
                person looks at information.
              </li>
              <li>
                We should use automation and ML at an acceptable level and
                ensure a human-in-the-loop decision making process.
              </li>
              <li>
                The designs should prioritize fairness over efficiency.
                Designing for fairness encompasses the need for efficiency.
                Tools and designs should aim to make weighing in fairness
                quicker, easier to read, and compare.

              Building off the reviewer's hesitation with machine learning
              interventions, we wanted to test our assumption that there was a
              way to introduce machine learning that wouldn’t have massive
              implications for bias while addressing a user need. We decided to
              make a conceptual prototype that could address the struggle to
              take notes and input reviews of each application into ApplyGrad,
              which takes a while and requires manual work for the reviewers and
              administrators.Our hypothesis was that a better review system
              within ApplyGrad that uses machine learning to do so can help
              expedite the review process without introducing new or additional
              bias into the admissions process.

              We employed a <strong>Wizard-of-Oz approach</strong> with Google
              Docs for our conceptual prototype. There were three applications
              for each reviewer to read, each consisting of a personal statement
              and resume. For the first application, the reviewer would think
              aloud as they went through the documents. They then moved on to
              the second application, where they used the normal Google Document
              functions of highlighting and commenting in their review. While
              the reviewer worked on the first two applications, the team took
              note of which pieces of information the reviewer deemed most
              important and highlighted analogous information in the third
              application. When the reviewer had completed their review of the
              first two applications, they began their review of the third
              application which had already been highlighted, thereby mimicking
              the function of a potential ML solution.

              We recruited 3 people from the HCI department to see if there were
              differences between reviewers within the same department. In
              addition, it was easier and quicker to generate fake data for a
              department that we were a part of due to FERPA regulations and
              time constraints. We only tested with three users and they are all
              from the MHCI program, so it is not a representative sample. In
              addition, HCII leans towards more holistic judgement rather than
              score-based, so it can not be generalized in this regard either.
              Due to time constraints, we also were unable to get through all
              three applications with each reviewer.
              <br /><br />
              If we decide to test this further, we will have to make the system
              extremely flexible and further explore collaborative highlighting
              between reviewers. We would also like to test the prototype with
              other departments and masters programs.
              <br /><br />
              Our general findings were that reviewers liked having control over
              the system and 2/3 started commenting and highlighting parts to
              themselves. They also liked how they could comment on the
              materials. Overall, reviewers diverged greatly in what they look
              for even with keywords. There was some concern about the
              highlighted information leading applicants to use “buzzwords” in
              their applications, but reviewers felt comfortable with factual
              information about their experience being highlighted.
              <br /><br /><br>More specifically, our insights included: <br>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                We can develop interfaces and interactions that make it easier
                to cross-reference similarities across application materials.
              </li>
              <li>
                Cross-referencing designs could help facilitate efficiency
                between reviewers and remembering information between admission
                meetings.
              </li>
              <li>
                Helping reviewers fill-in their gaps in knowledge for companies,
                internships, and classes could help them make better reviews.
              </li>
              <li>
                The solution we design should meet both the program’s needs for
                consistency and individual’s needs for flexibility.
              </li>
              <li>
                The tools we build must be robust to account for different
                keywords that people are looking for.
              </li>
              <li>
                In order to keep in account fairness, perhaps highlights can be
                part of a semi-blind check-in process.
