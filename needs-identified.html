          <div class="left-text">
            <p><br>Through our research, we found that more specifically, reviewers need more control of the data

              not well supported by ApplyGrad, reviewers usually turn to external tools outside of ApplyGrad for help,
              and such practice is commonly adopted by committees across SCS.

              ApplyGrad offers. When using ApplyGrad, committee administrators can easily contact the developer to make
              customized changes for their programs. However, when dealing with outside systems such as Slate, it’s not

              By addressing reviewers’ need of integration, we can greatly help them in efficiently finishing their
              work. Integrating features that can be found outside of ApplyGrad will help people pay attention to the
              task at hand. Integrating data manipulation functions will save a few hours between switching tabs and
              making reviewers receive their assigned applications faster.
              <br><br>
              In general, by integrating ApplyGrad to reviewers’ current natural workflow, we can really have a system
              that assist reviewers’ work to read and synthesize applications instead of hindering it, and greatly
              improving reviewers’ efficiency with the increasing number of applications they receive each year.

                There are many existing features in ApplyGrad that reviewers use to help them get to the next stage of
                review. However, many of these features are underutilized. In addition, people have gotten familiar with
                outside tools that for features are not available in ApplyGrad. ApplyGrad’s strength is its availability
                to be customized and quick support. No matter which design direction we go into, we must account for
                ApplyGrad’s unique history and add careful features that help get the users into the next stage faster.

            <p>Another need for reviewers emerged through our research. Typically, for each applicant, they need to send
              the following documents for a complete application:</p>
          </div>

          <ul>
            <li>Resume</li>

            <p><br>
              In addition, for some programs, applicants are also asked to submit video essays or portfolios. Different
              pieces of information about an applicant are spreaded out in different materials. When reviewers are
              reading these materials, they want a holistic view of the applicant, but lack the support to piece
              together information across documents. One reviewer specifically mentioned that:

              1. Reviewers need to remember and combine pieces of information from different materials to form a
              holistic view of an application.
              <br> <br>
              Given the number of documents for an application, reviewers usually conduct multi-tasking and swivel
              between documents to get background and context about an applicant. During our conceptual prototype
              testing, 3 out of 3 reviewers look for recurring subjects in material. Reviewers will make mental notes
              while looking across materials and look for things that they do not understand.

              2. Reviewers are frustrated with time-consuming, repetitive tasks, but prioritize properly evaluating
              applicants regardless of how long it might take.
              <br> <br>
              Even though reviewing one application takes much time and energy, reviewers expressed the desire to
              thoroughly read application materials and make fair judgement. This creates a conflict of effectiveness
              and efficiency, as a reviewer puts it:

            <p>Below is a screenshot from our conceptual prototype, where we prepared fake applicant data and observed

              reviewers will often make reviews in split-screen mode. This allows reviewers to make comments as they go

              reviewers to address fairness concerns.
              <br><br>
              1. Reviewers want to make fair evaluation calibration but it’s not supported by ApplyGrad
              <br> <br>
              Currently, reviewers seize to achieve a good calibration in their evaluations of application materials,
              including transcripts, resumes, and recommendation letters. Well-calibrated means that reviewers have a
              good understanding of the application pool and give consistent evaluation across different applications.
              Some reviewers take a look at a few applications to understand the application pool before doing actual
              evaluation and decision making, to form a basis for them to calibrate. There’s no way in ApplyGrad to
              check if reviewers are well-calibrated in their evaluations.

            <ul>
              <li>Lenient reviewers might score applicants higher than rigid reviewers in general, but ApplyGrad cannot
                help reviewers or administrators check that. </li>
              <li>ApplyGrad doesn’t provide information on schools’ grading systems, recommendation letter writers’
                writing skills, etc.</li>
            </ul>

              <br><br>
              2. ApplyGrad does not encompass current efforts to ensure fairness, so committees have to come up with
              their own practices
              <br> <br>
              Current efforts to promote fairness and equity include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Committee meetings at the beginning of each application year to align expectations and metrics
                reviewers would use.</li>
              <li>Administrators checking reviewers’ progress and statistics, and nudge them if they identify indicators
                for bias.</li>
              <li>Bias Buster workshop sessions done by Dr. Geoff Kaufman for many committees.</li>
            </ul>
            <br><br>
            <p>
              Committees of different programs usually have distinct concerns for fairness, which are not yet
              encompassed by ApplyGrad.

              Ensuring fairness with ApplyGrad can improve the general decision making quality and reduce bias in
              admission review. Integrating fairness-ensuring features in ApplyGrad can save current manual labor by
              administrators and reviewers.
              <br><br>
              Using ApplyGrad to help reviewers ensure fairness can help SCS manage standards to promote diversity,
              equity, and fairness in admission on an administrative level.

                Many opportunities lie in designing ApplyGrad to promote fairness and reduce bias in the review process.
                Since current efforts have been implemented by individual programs, we can identify current practices
                that can be assisted or amplified with ApplyGrad.
                <br><br>
                ApplyGrad can facilitate and introduce efforts to make admission at SCS more fair and equitable by:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>Introducing features to integrate existing fairness practices into ApplyGrad (e.g. tracking statistics on gender and ethnicity diversity of the admitted group).
                </li>
                <li>Providing tools to help reviewers calibrate their reviews and make fair decisions.
                </li>
                <li>Reminding reviewers with information about potential biases in ApplyGrad for each step of review and nudge them to take best practices.
                </li>
                <li>Aligning caseload assignments with the reviewer’s background and area of expertise.
                </li>
                <li>Including customizability to cater to different committees’ distinct needs and practices for fairness.
                </li>
              </ul>
